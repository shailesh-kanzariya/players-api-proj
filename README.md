## PGA Recruiting - Players API Project

The purpose of this project is to give you an opportunity to showcase your coding style with node.

You can use any tools (IDE, npm, ...) and resources (google, stackoverflow,...) you use in your day to day.
However, _you_ should come up with the implementation on your own.

## Overview

We need to manage players, with data consisting of: unique ID, name, team, status, and points.
For that purpose create a REST API with the following endpoints:
* `GET /players` — lists all players
* `POST /players` — creates new player
* `GET /players/:id` — get a player
* `DELETE /players/:id` — deletes a player
* `PUT /players/:id` — update a player

## Requirements

* Code must be written using `standardjs` convention

* Code should run in `Node 8.10`

* Use `./src/db.json` as a starting list of players — you can continue using `db.json` to store the players for this project, or you can just use it to import the players into a DB of your choice if that works better for you

* Free to use anything for developing and hosting the API (express, Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud etc.), anything works as long as it's JavaScript

## Submitting the project
 * Clone this repo
 * Implement a working solution
 * Submit the links to your PGA contact
